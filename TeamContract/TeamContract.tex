  {\Large\bfseries Team Contract}\\[10pt]
  {\normalsize Group 85}
\end{center}

The following contract outlines the foundation of how our team will work together throughout the remainder of this project. By establishing a shared understanding of the expectations, responsibilities, and standard of conduct governing participation, communication, division of work, and accountability, 
this contract aims to promote a professional and fair work environment. In the event of any conflicts, the contract also outlines the procedures to be taken for managing these conflicts, as well as guidelines for providing constructive feedback, ensuring that the team remains focused and aligned on the project goals. 
By agreeing to this contract, each member accepts both individual and group responsibility for ensuring the team's success.  

\section*{Team Purpose \& Mission}
Our team's mission is to design, build, and deliver a working MVP that is deployable, maintainable and extensible. As a team, we willingly take on this challenge of building a Machine Learning project from scratch, having minimal prior Machine Learning experience. To ensure project success,
we will prioritize both writing clear requirements and documentation and rapid iteration on TA and instructor feedback. Communication, both internally between team members and externally with the instructor and TA, will guide our learning and development experience.

\section*{Team Members}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Member 1: Karim Elbasiouni - elbasik@mcmaster.ca} 
  \item \textbf{Member 2: Imran Chowdhury - chowdi13@mcmaster.ca} 
  \item \textbf{Member 3: Rami Abu Sultan - abusultr@mcmaster.ca} 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Team Member Expectations \& Ground Rules}
The success of the group will depend on the cooperation and professionalism of its members. Each team member is expected to adhere to the list of items below, which outlines ground rules that are essential for an 
effective and positive team environment. These ground rules are guidelines on how each team member will conduct themselves and participate in group activities and responsibilities throughout the designated contract timeline.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each member should set aside an hour each week to communicate and participate in a weekly group meeting. If there is a reason the individual cannot meet virtually or physically for the agreed upon time, then the individual must give a valid reason or justification for his/her absence within 24 hours before the weekly team meeting.
  \item Each member should report at least once on a weekly basis indicating their progress and time spent. It is preferred that each team member reports their progress as frequently as possible. The mandatory weekly update should be reported 24-48 hours before the weekly group meeting
  \item If a member encounters a medical issue that will impact their ability to do their assigned work, the member should try their best to notify all other teammates within 24 hours of the situation.
\end{itemize}

    \hline
    \textbf{Role Name} & \textbf{Assignee} & \textbf{Role Description \& Responsibilities} \\
    \hline
    Project Manager & Karim Elbasiouni & Oversees project milestones, schedules meetings, and ensures team communication. \\
    \hline
    Backlog Manager & Imran Chowdhury &  Organizes, triages, and prioritizes GitHub issues so the team always has actionable, well-defined work to pick up. \\
    \hline
    Notetaker & Rami Abu Sultan & Acts as the notetaker for all team meetings, ensuring important discussions are summarized \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Team Roles and Responsibilities}
  \label{tab:roles}
\end{table}


\section*{Group Management \& Facilitation}
A mandatory team meeting will be held once weekly at an agreed upon time during the week. Depending on the week, the team may choose to cancel the meeting if other committments from other courses creep up, or add another meeting if the project timeline
requires it, such as in the case when there are many tasks to complete for an upcoming deadline. The Project Manager (Karim) schedules and facilitates these meetings, during which the Notetaker (Rami) records the meeting minutes.
Moreover, every milestone, the Backlog Manager (Imran) will prepare GitHub issues so that there is always actionable work to complete.\\

\noindent Communication outside of meetings will primarily take place through Microsoft Teams. Every team member is required to communicate as outlined in \textbf{Team Member Expectations \& Ground Rules}. This includes the weekly status updates before the weekly meetings, where each team member
describes the progress made since the last meeting, and what they plan to do until the next meeting, and any hurdles encounterd.\\

\noindent In the case of any conflicts within the team, team members will initially attempt to resolve the conflict informally by communicating respectfully. If the issue remains unresolved, a neutral third-party team member will act as mediator. If the conflict involves all team members, the Project Manager (Karim)
will act as a mediator. If after mediation, the conflict is still unresolved, then the team will outline a formal summary the issue and resolution attempt and submit it to the professor. The professor's recommended solution must be enforced by all team members. Failure to comply may result in further action
as decided by the professor or other faculty.
